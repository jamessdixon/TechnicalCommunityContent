# Analyzing Data in Real Time with Azure Stream Analytics #

---

&lt;a name=&quot;Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Overview ##

Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service for ingesting high-velocity data streaming from devices, sensors, applications, Web sites, and other data sources and analyzing that data in real time. It supports a SQL-like query language that works over dynamic data streams and makes analyzing constantly changing data no more difficult than performing queries on static data stored in traditional databases. With Azure Stream Analytics, you can set up jobs that analyze incoming data for anomalies or information of interest and record the results, present notifications on dashboards, or even fire off alerts to mobile devices. And all of it can be done at low cost and with a minimum of effort.

Scenarios for the application of real-time data analytics are legion and include fraud detection, identity-theft protection, optimizing the allocation of resources (think of an Uber-like transportation service that sends drivers to areas of increasing demand *before* that demand peaks), click-stream analysis on Web sites, shopping suggestions on retail-sales sites, and countless others. Having the ability to process data *as it comes in* rather than waiting until after it has been aggregated offers a competitive advantage to businesses that are agile enough to make adjustments on the fly.

In this lab, you'll create an Azure Stream Analytics job and use it to analyze data streaming in from simulated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. And you'll see how simple it is to monitor real-time data streams for information of significance to your research or business .And at the end, you will build a Web app that shows output from the Stream Analytics job in real time.

&lt;a name=&quot;Objectives&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### Objectives ###

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 1: Create an event hub ##

Azure Stream Analytics supports several types of input, including input from Azure blobs and input from Azure event hubs. Of the two, the latter is typically more interesting because in the IoT world, data is easily transmitted to Azure event hubs through field gateways (for devices that are not IP-capable) or cloud gateways (for devices that *are* IP-capable), and a single Azure event hub can handle millions of events per second transmitted from devices spread throughout the world.

In this exercise, you'll create an Azure event hub to provide input to Azure Stream Analytics and configure it to so that it can be accessed safely and securely by IoT devices and gateways. 

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). If you are asked to sign in, do so using your Microsoft account.

1. In the portal, click **+ New**, followed by **Internet of Things** and **Event Hubs**.

    ![Adding a new event hub](Images/new-event-hub.png)

    _Adding a new event hub_

1. Type a namespace name into the **Name** box. The name must be unique within Azure, so you will probably have to use something other than the name in the screen shot below. (A green check mark will appear in the box when the name you've entered is one that Azure will accept.) Select **Create new** under **Resource group** and enter the resource-group name &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; (without quotation marks). Choose the region closest to you in the **Location** drop-down, and then click the **Create** button.

    ![Creating a namespace](Images/create-namespace.png)

    _Creating a namespace_

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left, and then click the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group created in the previous step.

    ![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Wait until &quot;Deploying&quot; changes to &quot;Succeeded.&quot; Then click the namespace whose name you specified in Step 3.

	&gt; Click the browser's **Refresh** button occasionally to update the deployment status. Clicking the **Refresh** button in the resource-group blade refreshes the list of resources in the resource group, but does not reliably update the deployment status.

    ![Opening the namespace](Images/open-namespace.png)

    _Opening the namespace_

1. Click **+ Event Hub** to add an event hub to the namespace.

    ![Adding an event hub](Images/add-event-hub.png)

    _Adding an event hub_

1. Type &quot;inputhub&quot; (without quotation marks) into the **Name** box. Then click the **Create** button.

    ![Creating an event hub](Images/create-event-hub.png)

    _Creating an event hub_

1. Wait for the event hub to be created. Then scroll to the bottom of the blade and click the event hub name.

    ![Opening the event hub](Images/open-event-hub.png)

    _Opening the event hub_

1. In order to transmit events to the event hub from an application or device, you need to create a shared-access policy that includes Send permission. To begin, click **Shared access policies**, and then click **+ Add**.

    ![Adding a shared-access policy](Images/new-shared-access-policy.png)

    _Adding a shared-access policy_

1. Type &quot;SendPolicy&quot; (without quotation marks) into the **Policy name** box and check the **Send** box. Then click the **Create** button to create the new policy.

    ![Creating a send policy](Images/create-send-policy.png)

    _Creating a send policy_

1. Wait a moment for **SendPolicy** to appear in the policies list, and then click it.

    ![Opening the policy](Images/open-send-policy.png)

    _Opening the policy_

1. Click the **Copy** button to the right of the **CONNECTION STRING-PRIMARY KEY** box to copy the connection string containing the policy's shared-access key to the clipboard. Then temporarily save the connection string by pasting it into your favorite text editor. You'll need it in the next exercise.

    ![Copying the connection string to the clipboard](Images/copy-connection-string.png)

    _Copying the connection string to the clipboard_

You have created an event hub that can ingest events and be used as the source of input to a Stream Analytics job. You have also created a policy that allows holders of that policy to send events to the event hub, and a connection string that references that policy. The next step is to use the connection string to transmit events to the event hub.

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 2: Send events to the event hub ##
Applications, devices, and gateways can send events to Azure event hubs using the [Azure Event Hubs REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/Dn790674.aspx) or the [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol](https://www.amqp.org/), or AMQP for short. In this exercise, you will write a Windows console app that uses AMQP to send events to the event hub you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1). Each event will represent a withdrawal from an ATM machine, and will contain relevant information such as the card number used for the withdrawal, the time and amount of the withdrawal, and a unique identifier for the ATM machine used.

1. Start Visual Studio 2015 and use the **File -&gt; New -&gt; Project** command to create a new Windows Console Application named &quot;ATMEventGenerator.&quot;

    ![Creating a new console app](Images/mvc-new-console-app-2.jpg)

    _Creating a new console app_

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **ATMEventGenerator** project and select **Manage NuGet Packages...**

    ![Managing NuGet Packages for the project](Images/mvc-manage-nuget-packages-3.jpg)

    _Managing NuGet Packages for the project_

	&gt; NuGet is a free and open-source package manager for Microsoft development platforms. It provides access to thousands of libraries, or *packages*, containing code to perform a variety of tasks. It is integrated into Visual Studio 2015, which makes it easy to add NuGet packages to your project and make a lot of things happen without writing a lot of code.

1. Click **Browse**. Then type &quot;azure&quot; (without quotation marks) into the search box. Click **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus** to select the Azure service-bus package from NuGet. Finally, click **Install** to install the latest stable version of the package. This package contains the APIs that your app will use to send events to the event hub.

    ![Installing WindowsAzure.ServiceBus](Images/mvc-install-servicebus-package.png)

    _Installing WindowsAzure.ServiceBus_

1. If prompted to review changes, click **OK**. Optionally check **Do not show this again** so you won't be prompted again.

	![Reviewing changes](Images/mvc-review-changes.png)

	_Reviewing changes_

1. If prompted to accept a license for the package, click **I Accept**..

	![Accepting the package license](Images/mvc-accept-license.png)

	_Accepting the package license_

1. Return to the search box and type &quot;newtonsoft,&quot; again without quotation marks. Select **Newtonsoft.Json** and click **Install** to install the latest stable version of Json.NET. This package contains convenient APIs for generating and consuming JSON. If prompted to review changes, click **OK**.

    ![Installing Json.NET](Images/mvc-install-json.net-package.png)

    _Installing Json.NET_

1. Open **Program.cs** and add the following ```open``` statements to the top of the file:

	```F#
	open System
	open System.Text
	open Newtonsoft.Json
	open System.Runtime.Serialization
	open Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging
	```

1. Replace the rest of the file with the following implementation:

	```F#
	type Transaction = {TransactionId: int; TransactionTime: String; DeviceId: int; CardNumber:int; Amount:float}

	[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
	let main argv = 
	    let probability = 0.01
    	let connectionString = @&quot;your_connection_string_here&quot;
    	let random = new Random()
    	let client = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString)

	let generateTransaction transactionid =
        let transactionTime = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString()
        let deviceId = 12345 + random.Next(0, 88888)
        let testCardNumber = 123456789 + random.Next(0,888888888)
        let cardNumber =
            match(random.NextDouble() &lt; probability) with
            | true -&gt; -1
            | false -&gt; testCardNumber
        let amount = random.Next(1, 20) * 20 |&gt; float
        {TransactionId=transactionid;TransactionTime=transactionTime;DeviceId=deviceId;CardNumber=cardNumber;Amount=amount}   

	[|0..1000|]
	|&gt; Array.map(fun i -&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;[{0}] Event transmitted&quot;,i); i) 
        |&gt; Array.map(fun i -&gt; generateTransaction i)
        |&gt; Array.map(fun t -&gt; JsonConvert.SerializeObject(t))
        |&gt; Array.map(fun st -&gt; Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(st))
        |&gt; Array.map(fun b -&gt; new EventData(b))
        |&gt; Array.iter(fun ed -&gt; client.Send(ed))
        0 
	```

1. Replace *connection_string* in line 6 with the connection string you copied to the clipboard (and hopefully into your favorite text editor) in Exercise 1, Step 12.

2. Press **Ctrl+F5** to run the program and confirm that you see output similar to the following. Each line represents one event sent to the event hub, and events will roll by at a rate of several per second. (Rates will vary depending on your connection speed.) **Confirm that no exceptions are reported in the output**.

    ![Sending events to the event hub](Images/mvc-messages-sent-2.jpg)

    _Sending events to the event hub_

3. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the flow of events. Then press **Enter** to close the Command Prompt window.

In real life, there would be real ATM machines sending events to the event hub. 
 ATMEventGenerator simulates these events in software and sets the stage for you to build and test a Stream Analytics job that analyzes these events.
 If you need more than 1000 transactions sent, change the upper value of the array.
 For example, instead of [|0..1000|], use [|0..10000|] for 10,000 transactions to send.

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 3: Create a Stream Analytics job ##

In this exercise, you will use the Azure Portal to create a Stream Analytics job and connect it to the event hub you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1). You will also capture the raw data being passed to the Stream Analytics job from the event hub and examine its structure.

1. Return to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and click **+ New**, followed by **Internet of Things** and **Stream Analytics job**.

    ![Creating a Stream Analytics job](Images/new-stream-analytics-job.png)

    _Creating a Stream Analytics job_

1. Type &quot;ATMAnalytics&quot; (without quotation marks) into the **Job name** box. Select **Use Existing** under **Resource group** and select the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group that you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1). Select the region nearest you for **Location**. (It is important to select the same region that you selected for the event hub in Exercise 1, because you're not charged for data that moves within a data center, but you typically *are* charged for data that moves *between* data centers. In addition, locating services that talk to each other in the same data center reduces latency.) Then click the **Create** button.

    ![Specifying parameters for the Stream Analytics job](Images/create-stream-analytics-job.png)

    _Specifying parameters for the Stream Analytics job_

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left, and then click the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group.

    ![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Click **ATMAnalytics** to open the Stream Analytics job in the portal.

    ![Opening the Stream Analytics job](Images/open-stream-analytics-job.png)

    _Opening the Stream Analytics job_

1. Click **Inputs** to add an input to the Stream Analytics job.

    ![Adding an input](Images/add-input-1.png)

    _Adding an input_

1. Click **+ Add**.

    ![Adding an input](Images/add-input-2.png)

    _Adding an input_

1. Type &quot;Withdrawals&quot; (without quotation marks) into the **Input alias** box. Make sure **Source Type** is set to **Data stream** and **Source** is set to **Event hub**. Also make sure **Subscription** is set to **Use event hub from current subscription**, **Service bus namespace** is set to the namespace you specified in Exercise 1, Step 3, and the event hub you created in Exercise 1 (&quot;inputhub&quot;) is selected under **Event hub name**. Then select **RootManageSharedAccessKey** from the **Event hub policy name** drop-down and click the **Create** button at the bottom of the blade.

    ![Creating an input](Images/create-input.png)

    _Creating an input_

1. After a few moments, the new input — &quot;Withdrawals&quot; — appears in the list of inputs for the Stream Analytics job. Click it to open a blade for it.

    ![Opening the input](Images/open-input.png)

    _Opening the input_

1. Return to Visual Studio and start the ATMEventGenerator app again.

1. With ATMEventGenerator still running, return to the Azure Portal open in your browser and click **Sample Data**.

	![Sampling input data](Images/sample-data-1.png)

	_Sampling input data_

1. Click **OK** to begin sampling data from the input stream.

	![Specifying sampling parameters](Images/sample-data-2.png)

	_Specifying sampling parameters_

1. Wait a few seconds for sampling to complete, and when you are notified that the sample data can be downloaded, click to download it.

	![Data sampling completed](Images/sample-data-3.png)

	_Data sampling completed_

1. Click **Download** to download the data sampled from the input stream.

	![Downloading sample data](Images/sample-data-4.png)

	_Downloading sample data_

1. Save the JSON file that is downloaded to a location where you can easily find it. Then open the downloaded file in your favorite text editor and take a moment to examine its contents. How many rows (events) are represented in the sample data? What is the structure of each row — that is, what fields does each row contain?

	&gt; If you find the output hard to digest since there are no line breaks, try pasting it into an online JSON viewer such as the one at https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/. 

1. Return to the console window in which ATMEventGenerator is running and press **Ctrl+C** to stop it. Then press **Enter** to close the window.

You have connected a Stream Analytics job to an event hub and demonstrated that data is passed from one to the other. You have also sampled the data input to the Stream Analytics job and examined its structure. The next step is to do something with it — specifically, to bring the power of Azure Stream Analytics to bear on the data.  

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 4: Prepare queries and test with sample data ##

Now that your job is set up, there's much more you can do with Stream Analytics than simply view the raw data presented to it. The whole point of Stream Analytics is being able to query the data in real time. In this exercise, you'll use the [Stream Analytics Query Language](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/Dn834998.aspx) to query a sample data set for potentially fraudulent ATM transactions. It is always a good idea to test your queries against sample data before deploying them against live data streams, because with sample data, you can verify that a known set of inputs produces the expected outputs.

To flag potentially fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs, you will query for transactions performed with the same ATM card at different ATM machines within a specified time window (60 seconds). In real life, you would probably use a larger time window and perhaps even factor in the distance between ATM machines. However, a narrower time window is useful in a lab environment because it allows you to perform meaningful experiments in minutes rather than hours.

1. Begin by returning to the Stream Analytics job in the portal and clicking **Query**.

    ![Opening the query viewer](Images/add-query.png)

    _Opening the query viewer_

1. Click the **ellipsis** (the three dots) to the right of **Withdrawals** and select **Upload sample data from file** from the menu.

    ![Uploading sample data for testing queries](Images/upload-test-data-1.png)

    _Uploading sample data for testing queries_

1. Click the **folder** icon on the right and select the file named **Withdrawals.json** in this lab's &quot;resources&quot; directory. Then click **OK** to upload the file.

    ![Uploading Withdrawals.json](Images/upload-test-data-2.png)

    _Uploading Withdrawals.json_

1. When the upload is complete, enter the following query, and then click the **Test** button to execute it against the sample data you uploaded:

	```sql
	SELECT * FROM Withdrawals
	```

	&gt; Where did the name &quot;Withdrawals&quot; come from? That's the alias you assigned to the event-hub input in the previous exercise. If you named it differently, you'll need to replace &quot;Withdrawals&quot; with the alias you used.

    ![Testing a query](Images/test-query-1.png)

    _Testing a query_

1. Confirm that you see the output pictured below. The test data contains 607 rows. Each row has fields named TRANSACTIONID, TRANSACTIONTIME, DEVICEID, CARDNUMBER, and AMOUNT. DEVICEID is the ID of the ATM machine at which the transaction took place. AMOUNT is the amount of cash withdrawn from the ATM.

    ![Query results](Images/query-results-1.png)

    _Query results_

1. Suppose you only wanted to view transactions for amounts between 200 and 300, inclusive. Furthermore, suppose you wanted to clean up the output by assigning your own column names and excluding the TRANSACTIONID column. Enter the following query and click **Test** again to execute it.

	```sql
	SELECT TransactionTime as [Time of Transaction],
	       DeviceID as [ATM],
	       CardNumber as [Card Number],
	       Amount as [Amount]
	FROM Withdrawals
	WHERE Amount &gt;= 200 and Amount &lt;= 300
	```

1. Confirm that the query generated the following output:

    ![Customizing the output](Images/query-results-2.png)

    _Customizing the output_

1. One of the key features of the Stream Analytics Query Language is its ability to group results using windows of time whose length you specify. To demonstrate, enter the following query to count the number of transactions taking place each minute and click **Test** to execute it:

	```sql
	SELECT System.Timestamp as [Time Ending],
        COUNT(*) AS [Number of Transactions]
    FROM Withdrawals TIMESTAMP BY TransactionTime
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(n, 1)
	```

	&gt; TIMESTAMP BY is an important element of the Stream Analytics Query Language. If it was omitted from the query above, you would be querying for the number of transactions that arrived *at the event hub* each minute rather than the number of transactions that occurred in each 1-minute interval. TIMESTAMP BY allows you to specify a field in the input stream as the event time.

1. Confirm that you see the output below:

    ![Querying for the number of transactions per minute](Images/query-results-3.png)

    _Querying for the number of transactions per minute_

1. Now it's time to query the test data for potentially fraudulent transactions — transactions involving the same ATM card but different ATM machines that take place within 60 seconds of each other. *This is the query you will use in a subsequent exercise against a live data stream*.

	Enter the following query and click **Test** to execute it:

	```sql
	SELECT W1.CardNumber as [CardNumber],
	    W1.DeviceID as [ATM1], W2.DeviceID as [ATM2],
	    W1.TransactionTime as [Time1], W2.TransactionTime as [Time2]
	FROM Withdrawals W1 TIMESTAMP BY TransactionTime
	JOIN Withdrawals W2 TIMESTAMP BY TransactionTime
	ON W1.CardNumber = W2.CardNumber
	AND DATEDIFF(ss, W1, W2) BETWEEN 0 and 60
	WHERE W1.DeviceID != W2.DeviceID
	```

1. This time the output should contain just three rows, each representing two transactions performed with one ATM card at two different locations within 60 seconds of each other:

    ![Detecting potentially fraudulent transactions](Images/query-results-4.png)

    _Detecting potentially fraudulent transactions_

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the blade to save the query. Then click **Yes** when asked to confirm.

    ![Saving the query](Images/save-query.png)

    _Saving the query_

With the query now formulated, tested against a set of sample data, and saved, it's almost time to deploy it against a live data stream to produce a running record of potentially fraudulent transactions. But first, you need to add an output to the Stream Analytics job.

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 5: Add an event hub for output ##

Being able to run queries and see the results in the portal is great for testing, but the whole point of Stream Analytics is being able to query live data streams. Azure Stream Analytics supports a variety of output types, including blobs, Azure SQL databases, and event hubs. You can designate blob storage as the destination for output from a Stream Analytics job to generate a persistent record of query results. Another useful scenario involves using event hubs as output. Because software can subscribe to events from event hubs, developers can build custom applications that show Stream Analytics output in real time.

In this exercise, you will create an event hub for output, and then configure the Stream Analytics job to write output to the event hub. In the next exercise, you will write an app that connects to the output event hub.

1. Return to the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group and click the event-hub namespace you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

    ![Opening the namespace](Images/open-namespace-2.png)

    _Opening the namespace_

    ![Opening the event hub](Images/open-event-hub-2.png)

    _Opening the event hub_

1. In order to receive events from an event hub, you need to create a shared-access policy that includes Listen permission. To begin, click **Shared access policies**, and then click **+ Add**.

    ![Adding a shared-access policy](Images/new-shared-access-policy-2.png)

    _Adding a shared-access policy_

    _Copying the connection string to the clipboard_

1. Return to the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group and click **ATMAnalytics** to open the Stream Analytics job in the portal.

    ![Opening the Stream Analytics job](Images/open-stream-analytics-job.png)

    _Opening the Stream Analytics job_

1. Click **Outputs**.

    ![Creating an output](Images/add-output-1.png)

    _Creating an output_

1. Click **+ Add**.

    ![Adding an output](Images/add-output-2.png)

    _Adding an output_

1.  Type &quot;FlaggedWithdrawals&quot; (without quotation marks) into the **Output alias** box. Make sure **Sink** is set to **Event hub** and **Import option** is set to **Use event hub from current subscription**. Under **Service bus namespace**, select the namespace you created in [Exercise1](#Exercise1), and select **outputhub** from the **Event hub name** list. Set **Event hub policy name** to **RootManageSharedAccessKey**, and then click **Create**.

    ![Creating an output](Images/create-output-2.png)

    _Creating an output_

Now that you have directed the output from the Stream Analytics job to an event hub, the next task is to write an app that consumes events from that event hub.

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 6: Build a real-time dashboard ##

In this exercise, you will use Visual Studio to write an ASP.NET MVC Web app that connects to the output event hub and displays real-time notifications of potentially fraudulent transactions. You will also create a storage account required by the dashboard.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and click **+ New** in the ribbon on the left. Then click **Storage**, followed by **Storage account**.

    ![Adding a storage account](Images/new-storage-account.png)

    _Adding a storage account_

1. In the ensuing blade, enter a name for the new storage account in **Name** field.

	&gt; Storage account names must be 3 to 24 characters in length and can only contain numbers and lowercase letters. In addition, the name you enter must be unique within Azure.

	Once you have a unique name that Azure will accept (as indicated by the green check mark in the **Name** field), select **Use existing** under **Resource group** and select the resource group named &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; so the storage account will belong to the same resource group as the Stream Analytics job and the event hub. Select the location nearest you (the same one you selected for the event hub in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1) and the Stream Analytics job in [Exercise 3](#Exercise3)) in the **Location** box. Then click the **Create** button at the bottom of the blade.
    
	![Creating a storage account](Images/create-storage-account.png)

    _Creating a storage account_

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left, and then click the &quot;StreamAnalyticsResourceGroup&quot; resource group.

    ![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Click the storage account you created in Step 2.

    ![Opening the storage account](Images/open-storage-account.png)

    _Opening the storage account_

1. Click **Access keys**, and click the **Copy** button to the right of the **key1** box to the copy the storage account's access key to the clipboard. Then temporarily save the access key by pasting it into your favorite text editor. You'll need it later in this exercise.

	![Copying the access key](Images/copy-storage-access-key.png)

    _Copying the access key_

1. Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015 and use the **File -&gt; New -&gt; Project** command to create a new ASP.NET Web Application named &quot;ATMDashboard.UX.&quot;

    ![Creating a new Web app](Images/mvc-new-web-application-1.jpg)

    _Creating a new Web app_

1. In the &quot;New ASP.NET Project&quot; dialog, select **MVC** and check the **Web API** box. If **Host in the cloud** is checked, uncheck it. (For testing purposes, you will run this Web app locally.) Then click **OK**.

    ![Specifying parameters for the Web app](Images/mvc-new-web-application-2.png)

    _Specifying parameters for the Web app_

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click **File -&gt; New -&gt; Project** command to create a new FSharp Library Project named &quot;ATMDashboard&quot;

    ![Creating a new Library app](Images/mvc-new-library-application-1.jpg)

    _Creating a new Library app 1_

    ![Creating a new Library app](Images/mvc-new-library-application-2.jpg)

    _Creating a new Library app 2_

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **ATMDashboard.UX** project and select **Add Reference...** and Select the **ATMDashboard** project.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **ATMDashboard** project and select **Manage NuGet Packages...**

    ![Managing NuGet Packages for the project](Images/mvc-manage-nuget-packages-2.png)

    _Managing NuGet Packages for the project_

1. Click **Browse**. Then type &quot;eventprocessor&quot; (without quotation marks) into the search box. Click **Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.EventProcessorHost** to select the Azure EventProcessorHost package from NuGet. Finally, click **Install** to install the latest stable version of the package. This package contains the APIs that your app will use to receive events from the output event hub. Click **OK** if you're prompted review changes, and **I Accept** when prompted to accept licenses for the downloaded packages.

    ![Installing EventProcessorHost](Images/mvc-install-eventprocessorhost.png)

    _Installing EventProcessorHost_

1. Right-click the library project in the Solution Explorer window and Select the Library1 file and rename it to **ATMEvents.fs**.

    ![Adding the ATMEvent class](Images/mvc-rename-event-file.jpg)

    _Rename Events File_

1. Add the following ```namespace``` and ```open``` statements at the top of the file:

	```F#
	namespace ATMDashboard

	open System
	open System.Text
	open Newtonsoft.Json
	open System.Diagnostics
	open System.Threading.Tasks
	open System.Collections.Generic
	open Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging
	```

1. Implement the ```ATMEvent``` record type as follows:

	```F#
	type ATMEvent = {
    	CardNumber:string;
    	ATM1:string;ATM2:string;
    	Time1:string;Time2:string}
	```

1. Below the ATMEvent type, add the ATMEventAggregator implementation:

	```F#
	type ATMEventAggregator() =
    	static member events = List&lt;ATMEvent&gt;()
    	static member LogEvent(event) =
        	match ATMEventAggregator.events.Count &lt; 1024 with
        	| true -&gt; ATMEventAggregator.events.Add(event)
        	| false -&gt; ()
    	static member GetLoggedEvents() =
        	let eventArray = ATMEventAggregator.events.ToArray()
        	ATMEventAggregator.events.Clear()
        	eventArray
	```

1. Below the ATMEventAggregator type, add the SimpleEventProcessor implementation:

	```F#
	type SimpleEventProcessor() =
    	let checkpointStopWatch = new Stopwatch()
    		interface IEventProcessor with
        	member this.CloseAsync(context, reason) = 
            		Debug.WriteLine(&quot;Processor Shutting Down. Partition '{0}', Reason: '{1}'.&quot;, context.Lease.PartitionId, reason)
            		match reason with 
            		| CloseReason.Shutdown -&gt; context.CheckpointAsync() 
            		| _ -&gt; Task.CompletedTask   
        	member this.OpenAsync(context) =
            		Debug.WriteLine(&quot;SimpleEventProcessor initialized.  Partition: '{0}', Offset: '{1}'&quot;, context.Lease.PartitionId, context.Lease.Offset)
            		checkpointStopWatch.Start()
            		Task.CompletedTask
        	member this.ProcessEventsAsync(context, messages) =
            		messages
            		|&gt; Seq.map(fun ed -&gt; Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ed.GetBytes()))
            		|&gt; Seq.map(fun b -&gt; Debug.WriteLine(String.Format(&quot;Message received.  Partition: '{0}', Data: '{1}'&quot;, context.Lease.PartitionId, b)); b)
            		|&gt; Seq.map(fun b -&gt; JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;ATMEvent&gt;(b))
            		|&gt; Seq.iter(fun e -&gt; ATMEventAggregator.LogEvent(e))
            
            		match checkpointStopWatch.Elapsed &gt; TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0) with
            		| true -&gt; checkpointStopWatch.Restart()
                      		context.CheckpointAsync()
            		| false -&gt; Task.CompletedTask
	```

1. Compile the ATMEvents project and open the ATMEvents.UX project:

1. Open **Global.asax.cs** and add the following ```using``` statements:

	```C#
	using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
	using System.Diagnostics;
	using ATMEvents;
	```

1. In **Global.asax.cs**, add the following statements to the end of the ```Application_Start``` method:

	```C#
    string eventHubConnectionString = &quot;connection_string&quot;;
    string eventHubName = &quot;outputhub&quot;;
    string storageAccountName = &quot;storage_account_name&quot;;
    string storageAccountKey = &quot;storage_account_key&quot;;
    string storageConnectionString = string.Format(&quot;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={0};AccountKey={1}&quot;, storageAccountName, storageAccountKey);

    string eventProcessorHostName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    EventProcessorHost eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(eventProcessorHostName, eventHubName, EventHubConsumerGroup.DefaultGroupName, eventHubConnectionString, storageConnectionString);
    Debug.WriteLine(&quot;Registering EventProcessor...&quot;);
    var options = new EventProcessorOptions();
    options.ExceptionReceived += (sender, e) =&gt; { Debug.WriteLine(e.Exception); };
    eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync&lt;SimpleEventProcessor&gt;(options).Wait();

    Debug.WriteLine(&quot;Receiving...&quot;);
	```

1. Replace *connection_string* in line 1 with the connection string you copied to the clipboard (and hopefully into your favorite text editor) in Exercise 5, Step 8.

1. Remove &quot;;EntityPath=outputhub&quot; from the end of the connection string. The ```eventHubConnectionString``` variable declaration should now look something like this:

	```C#
	string eventHubConnectionString = &quot;Endpoint=sb://streamanalytics-lab.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=ReceivePolicy;SharedAccessKey=3XHaU3pm5t82WxA43hUM/bWa7kQmuAsqzJ1rVJq3Qv0=&quot;;
	```

1. Replace *storage_account_name* in line 3 with the the name of the storage account you created in Step 2 of this exercise, and *storage_account_key* in line 4 with the access key you saved in Step 5.

	&gt; This storage account has nothing to do with the Stream Analytics job; it's used by the EventProcessorHost class.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the &quot;Controllers&quot; folder and use the **Add -&gt; Controller** command to add an empty Web API 2 controller.

    ![Adding a Web API Controller](Images/mvc-add-api-controller.png)

    _Adding a Web API Controller_

1. Name the controller &quot;EventsController&quot; (without quotation marks). Then click **Add**.

    ![Naming the Web API Controller](Images/mvc-add-controller-dialog.png)

    _Naming the Web API Controller_

1. Add the following method to the ```EventsController``` class:

	```C#
    public ATMEvent[] GetEvents()
    {
        return ATMEventAggregator.GetLoggedEvents();
    }
	```

	&gt; The controller you just added is a Web API controller. It exposes a REST method that can be called over HTTP to retrieve the latest events that ATMEventAggregator received from the event hub.

1. Open **Index.cshtml** in the project's &quot;Views/Home&quot; folder and replace its contents with the following statements:

	```HTML
	@{
	    ViewBag.Title = &quot;Home Page&quot;;
	}

	&lt;div class=&quot;jumbotron&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;h1&gt;ATM Dashboard&lt;/h1&gt;
	    &lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;The table below lists potentially fraudulent ATM transactions and is updated every 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
	        &lt;table id=&quot;output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt;
	            &lt;tr&gt;
	                &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Card Number&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
	                &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;ATM 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
	                &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;ATM 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
	            &lt;/tr&gt;
	        &lt;/table&gt;
	    &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	
	@section scripts {
	&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
	    $(function () {
	        // Check for new events every 5 seconds
	        window.setInterval(function () {
	            $.ajax({
	                url: &quot;/api/events&quot;,
	                success: function (result) {
	                    for (i = 0; i &lt; result.length; i++) {
	                        $(&quot;#output tr:last&quot;).after(&quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + result[i][&quot;cardnumber&quot;] + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + result[i][&quot;atm1&quot;] + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + result[i][&quot;atm2&quot;] + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;);
	                    }
	                },
	                error: function (xhr, status, error) {
	                    if (status == &quot;error&quot;) {
	                        console.log(&quot;Error: &quot; + xhr.status);
	                    }
	                },
	                dataType: &quot;json&quot;
	            });
	        }, 5000);
	    });
	&lt;/script&gt;
	}
	```

	&gt; See what's happening here? In addition to modifying the view's UI to include an HTML table in which ATM events can be displayed, you added a script block that uses jQuery's $.ajax method to call back to the server every 5 seconds. The endpoint for the call is the method you implemented in the Web API controller in the previous step. When that method returns one or more events, rows are added to the table to display them.

1. Go to the **Build** menu at the top of the Visual Studio window and use the **Build Solution** command to build the solution. Correct any build errors that are reported, and then press **Ctrl+F5** to launch the application in your browser. Confirm that the application looks like this:

    ![The ATM dashboard](Images/mvc-atm-dashboard.png)

    _The ATM dashboard_

Leave the browser open with the application running. And don't be alarmed if a few  events show up the first few seconds the dashboard is open. Those are simply events that the event hub cached. You'll be generating new events in the next exercise.

&lt;a name=&quot;Exercise7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Exercise 7: Analyze a live data stream ##

Almost there! Now it's time to run the Stream Analytics job and see the output in your dashboard.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and open the blade for the Stream Analytics job. Then click **Start**.

    ![Starting the Stream Analytics job](Images/start-stream-analytics-job-1.png)

    _Starting the Stream Analytics job_

1. Make sure **Job output start time** is set to **Now**, and then click the **Start** button to start running the job.

    ![Specifying the job start time](Images/start-stream-analytics-job-2.png)

    _Specifying the job start time_

1. Wait until the Stream Analytics job starts. Then return to the instance of Visual Studio in which the ATMEventGenerator project is open and start ATMEventGenerator again to pump events into the input event hub.

	&gt; If you'd like, you can run several instances of ATMEventGenerator simultaneously to increase the volume of events.

1. Return to the ATMDashboard application running in your browser and watch for a few minutes. Every so often, a line should appear representing a potentially fraudulent transaction and identifying the ATM card number and the ATMs at which the card was used.

    ![Potentially fraudulent transactions](Images/mvc-atm-dashboard-output.png)

    _Potentially fraudulent transactions_

1. Return to the Stream Analytics job in the portal and click the **Stop** button to stop it. Then click **Yes** when asked if you're sure you want to stop the job.

    ![Stopping the Stream Analytics job](Images/stop-stream-analytics-job.png)

    _Stopping the Stream Analytics job_

1. Return to the console window in which ATMEventGenerator is running and press **Ctrl+C** to terminate it.

You now have a Web app that displays output from a Stream Analytics job in near real-time. There are other ways to build such dashboards, including [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). With Power BI, you can create dashboards that render output from Stream Analytics jobs without writing any code. For more information, refer to [Stream Analytics &amp; Power BI: A real-time analytics dashboard for streaming data](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard/).

&lt;a name=&quot;Summary&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## Summary ##

Azure Stream Analytics is a powerful tool for analyzing live data streams from IoT devices or anything else that's capable of transmitting data. In this lab, you got a first-hand look at Stream Analytics as well as Azure event hubs. Among other things, you learned how to:

- Create an Azure event hub and use it as a Stream Analytics input
- Write a C# app that transmits events to an event hub
- Create a Stream Analytics job and test queries on sample data streams
- Run a Stream Analytics job and perform queries on live data streams
- Create a rule (query) that detects anomalies in streaming data
- Display output from a Stream Analytics job in a Web app

One drawback to hard-coding rules into Stream Analytics is that rules don't &quot;learn&quot; from the data streams, which can lead to false positives in anomaly detection. If this concerns you, read the article entitled [Anomaly Detection – Using Machine Learning to Detect Abnormalities in Time Series Data](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2014/11/05/anomaly-detection-using-machine-learning-to-detect-abnormalities-in-time-series-data.aspx) in the Azure team's Machine Learning blog. In it, they present an anomaly detection service accessible through a REST API that uses Azure Machine Learning to learn from the data presented to it. Imagine combining the power of Stream Analytics to extract information from real-time data streams with the power of Azure Machine Learning to learn from that information and refine the analytics on the fly. This is precisely the type of solution that Microsoft Azure empowers you to build!
